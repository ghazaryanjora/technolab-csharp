2. For the given number of iterations `n` calculate approximation of pi using the Leibniz formula: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz_formula_for_%CF%80)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz_formula_for_%CF%80). *Side quest: watch a video on Newton's formula for pi: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMlf1ELvRzc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMlf1ELvRzc) *

**Git**

1. Fork the repository [https://github.com/sarustamyan/technolab-csharp](https://github.com/sarustamyan/technolab-scharp) (see [https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) for help)

## Lesson 3 - Arrays

### In Class

1. Arrays, high-level overview.
2. String representations. ASCII vs Unicode.

**Coding**

1. Find the max item of the array
2. Convert a string to lowercase

### Home Assignments

1. Print "True" if the given string is a palindrome (i.e. if it reads the same both left-to-right and right-to-left), "False" otherwise. I.e. for "car" the program should print "False", whereas for "racecar" it should print "True".
2. For a given string, find the number of words in it. I.e. for the string "There are only 10 types of people in the world: those who understand binary and those who don't." the answer should be 18. 
3. Find the second smallest item of the array. You can assume there are no duplicates.
4. For the given arrays `a1` and `a2`, find all the items that belong to both `a1` and `a2`.
